# Work-Day-Scheduler
A calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day

## Features:
In this project, I coded an calendar application with the following features:

- The current date at the top automatically updates to the current date
- User can input and save tasks for each hour of the day
- Display all tasks of the day when User open the planner 
- Color-code the planner based on past, present, and future hours
- User can save the input tasks using any buttons on the right hand side
- Tasks for each hour are saved to localStorage and get display when the planner is open or refreshed
- User can select different ranges of hour (0-24) to display in the script.js. Designed to be inclusive for those with night shift, flexible hours or 24/7 global team coverage! :)
